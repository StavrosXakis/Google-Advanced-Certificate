# The Power of Statistics
## What I took from those activities? - Let's see:
This course emphasizes how you could use `statistics` to help you draw conclusions `using Python`:

• Firstly, I explored the role of statistics in data science and identified the difference between `descriptive` and `inferential statistics`. I learned how descriptive statistics can help me quickly summarize a dataset and measure the center, spread, and relative position of data.

• I have learned the basic rules for `calculating probability` for single events. Next, I discovered how data professionals use methods such as `Bayes’ theorem` to describe more complex events. Then, I learned how `probability distributions` such as the `binomial`, `Poisson`, and `normal distribution` can help me better understand the structure of data. In addition, I learned the significance and use of `z-scores` and I used the `Empirical Rule` to confirm a `Gaussian distribution`.

• As Data professionals use smaller samples of data to draw conclusions about large datasets, I learned about the different methods they use to collect and analyze `sample data` and how they `avoid sampling bias`. I also learned how `sampling distributions` can help me make accurate estimates.

• I explored how data professionals use `confidence intervals` to describe the uncertainty of their estimates. I learned how to construct and interpret confidence intervals using Python — and how to `avoid some common misinterpretations`.

• Additionally, I conducted `Hypothesis testing` using Python, a method that helps data professionals determine if the results of a test or experiment are statistically significant or due to chance. I learned the difference between a `type I error` and a `type II error` as well as about the basic steps for any hypothesis test and how hypothesis testing can help me draw meaningful conclusions about data.

• Finally, I combined all the new fascinating things I learned to continue the Waze churn project I am developing from the previous courses.
