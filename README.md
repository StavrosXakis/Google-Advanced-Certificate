# Stavros Xakis
## Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate Repository

### Introduction
Hello! My name is Stavros Xakis, and this repository contains the labs and projects completed during the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate. Each folder represents a module in the Certificate, and inside you'll find the Jupyter Notebooks I used to complete the activities along with my code solutions and notes.

### Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

- `Folder1/`: Exercises for Module 1 (Foundations of Data Science)
- `Folder2/`: Exercises for Module 2 (Get Started with Python)
- `Folder3/`: Exercises for Module 3 (Go Beyond the Numbers Translate Data into Insights)
- `...` (and so on)

### How to Navigate
- For each module, navigate to the corresponding folder.
- Inside each module's folder, you will find the labs I completed during the mudule as well as the end-of-course project that I build at the end of each module.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: For scripting and running data analysis tasks.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For math functions and descriptive statistics.
- **Matplotlib.pyplot**: For manipulation of visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For appealing visualizations.
- **Plotly.express**: For map visualizations.
- **Datetime**: For datetime manipulations.
- **stats from SciPy**: For statistical analysis.
- **Tableau**: For visualization dashboards.

### Projects
The end-of-course project of each module was created according to a workplace scenario with continuous development between modules. More specifically, my chosen scenario was the Waze churn project.

**Project goal:**
"Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business."

**Background:**
Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. 

### Labs
There are multiple activity labs across each module, designed to offer hands-on experience. In each lab, I practiced and executed every concept, method, and technique I learned through the Instructor's videos, reading material, and annotated follow-along guides which are built Jupyter Notebooks that illustrate the use of each subject in real-life data.
