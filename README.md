# Stavros Xakis
## Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate Repository

### Introduction
Hello! My name is Stavros Xakis, and this repository contains the labs and projects completed during the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate. Each folder represents a module in the Certificate, and inside you'll find the Jupyter Notebooks I used to complete the activities along with my code solutions and notes.

### Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

#### **Module Activity Lab Files:**
There are multiple activity labs across each module, designed to offer hands-on experience. In each lab, I practiced and executed every concept, method, and technique I learned through the Instructor's videos, reading material, and annotated follow-along guides which are built Jupyter Notebooks that illustrate the use of each subject in real-life data.

- **`Foundations of Data Science`**:  
> Module 1. No labs available - Practiced on how to stucture my workflow based on the PACE method (Plan,Analyze,Construct,Execute).
- **`Get Started with Python/`:**
> Activity Labs of the Course (Module 2). In this module I practiced on Python's basic topics such as "Python Syntax", "for/while loops", "Conditional Statements", "NumPy Functions", "List/Tuples/Dictionaries/Sets" and "Pandas".
- **`Go Beyond the Numbers Translate Data into Insights/`:**
> Activity Labs of the Course (Module 3). In this module I went through each step of the EDA procedure. I practiced on how to clean my data, how to address missing values, how to address outliers, how to structure my data, how to create and interpret visualizations.
- **`The Power of Statistics/`**: 
> Activity Labs of the Course (Module 4). In this lab I practiced on conducting Statistical Analysis with Python. More specificaly, I used Jupyter Notebooks to explore descriptive statistics, probability distributions, sampling, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.
- **`Regression Analysis: Simplify Complex Data Relationships/`:**
> In progress (Module 5)...
- **`The Nuts and Bolts of Machine Learning/`:**
> In progress (Module 6)...
- **`Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone/`:**
> In progress (Final Project)...

#### **End-of-Course Projects:**
The end-of-course project of each module was created according to a workplace scenario with continuous development between modules. More specifically, my chosen scenario was the Waze churn project.

**Project goal:**
"Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business."

**Background:**
Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. 

### How to Navigate
- For each module, navigate to the corresponding folder.
- Inside each module's folder, you will find the activity labs I completed during the mudule.
- Inside the End-of-Course Projects folder, you will finde the project that I build at the end of each module.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: For scripting and running data analysis tasks.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For math functions and descriptive statistics.
- **Matplotlib.pyplot**: For manipulation of visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For appealing visualizations.
- **Plotly.express**: For map visualizations.
- **Datetime**: For datetime manipulations.
- **stats from SciPy**: For statistical analysis.
- **Tableau**: For visualization dashboards.
