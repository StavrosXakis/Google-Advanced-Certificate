# End-of-Course Projects Waze dataset

## Project goal:   
Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.

## Background: 
Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. 

## Jupyter Notebooks:
There is one Jupyter Notebook per Module. In each module, we develop our project according to the milestones outlined at the project proposal I conducted in Module 1 (Foundations of Data Science). Inside the Jupyter Notebooks, you will find my coding in combination along with step-by-step annotations as well as my answers to several key questions of the procedure. At the end of each Jupyter Notebook, there are my conclusions and key insights with which the relevant stakeholders should be informed.

## Executive Summaries:  
There is one PDF file accompaning each Jupyter Notebook. This file contains an Executive Summary. An Executive Summary, is an one-page format document designed to respect teammates and stakeholders who may not have time to read and understand an entire report. There, I present briefly the project overview, the details and key insights of my findings, as well as the next steps that the project should proceed.

### Project per Module:

#### **Get Started with Python (Module 2)**:

**Module's Scenario:**  
"Your team is in the early stages of their user churn project. Your project proposal has been approved and your team has been given access to Waze’s user data. To get clear insights, the data must first be inspected, organized, and prepared for analysis."

**My assignment:**
"You will build a dataframe for the churn data. After the dataframe is complete, you will organize the data for the process of exploratory data analysis, and update the team on your progress and insights."

**Procedure Summary:**
For the cause of my analysis, I used the Libraries Pandas and NumPy. Firstly, I imported the provided data to a data frame for inspection. Then, I summarized my data reviewing the available data types, number of variables/observations, and summary statistics while I also checked for Null Values. As the next step, I isolated the data frame of the revealed null values to a second data frame and compared it with the initial trying to find the cause of the missing values. After dealing with null values, I continued by exploring my dataset with respect to my main  variable (label) which labels the users as retained or churned. Placed in the early stages of an analytical procedure, my goal was to explore the data, identify relationships between the available variables, and acknowledge the representative percentage of categorical variables, to understand the reasons that led a user to churn.
